# Classifier-Chains
Classifier chains blog post 

This repository provides a simple implementation of classifier chains in python and tests the implementation on the problem of 
predicting whether a paper is labelled as algebraic geometry, number theory or both. Most of the code is thoroughly explained in [this blog post](https://olivereanderson.github.io/2019/05/21/Multi-label-classification-and-esoteric-text-preparation.html). 

The repository also contains a class called `MultilabelAnalyser`that provides functionality to get an overview of a dataset of samples 
associated with multi-labels.
